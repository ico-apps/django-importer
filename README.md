# django-importer
Another CSV importer based on Django.


## Default import log views
If you want to use the default import log views (list and detail), you should include in the template folder of your project `djimporter/base.html` template. This way you could set the layout and style of your project. For example the content could be:
```html
{% extends "myproject/base.html %}
{% block content %}{% endblock %}
```
